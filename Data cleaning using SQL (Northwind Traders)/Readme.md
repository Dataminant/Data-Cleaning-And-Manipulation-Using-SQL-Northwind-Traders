# Data cleaning using SQL (Northwind Traders)

### Detecting and Removing Duplicated
I started by getting all the variables from Orders table so I can look at the summary of the data gathered. I look for duplicates and errors, or patterns that jump out visually. I see duplicated customerID straight away. The Orders table consist of 830 rows. It has 13 columns (CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, RequiredDate, ShippedDate, ShipVia, Freight, ShipName,ShipAddress, ShipCity, ShipRegion, ShipPostalCode and ShipCountry).
