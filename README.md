# Data-Cleaning-And-Manipulation-Using-SQL-Northwind-Traders

## Introduction

This project involves a database from “Northwind Traders” an import-export company, it is not only one table but several of them (customers, orders, inventory, invoices, supplies and shipping as well as employees). 

My goal is to clean up and transform the data using SQL functions before moving on with analysis. My primary work involves handling duplicate data, working on Nulls data and applying conditions to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent and free of errors, as incorrect or inconsistent data can negatively impact the outcome of my analysis.

## Conclusion

In order for companies to fully utilize their data, data cleansing is an essential step in the data preparation process. Data cleaning and manipulation takes time and effort, but the results are better because it helps in making improved data-driven decisions and more informed business strategies.

By identifying and fixing several data abnormalities or inconsistencies, such as duplicate values or missing entries, this project shows the need of data cleaning and manipulation. An efficient method for improving data accuracy and consistency was used in the SQL queries  to manipulate the databases to clean the data.
